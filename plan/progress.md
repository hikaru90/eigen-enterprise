## 2026-09-07 — Phase 0 kickoff

**Shipped**
- `plan/phase-0-kernel.md` — approved architecture (grilled across 5 rounds)
- Repo seeded from eigen (`c4642f1` — tree unmodified: rsync w/o `.git`, `node_modules`, artifacts, `.env`)
- `AGENTS.md` — orchestrator model + guardrails written

**In progress**
- Strip: `billing/` (keep `llm/gateway-cost`), eigenmesh branding, PWA/service-worker, product deploy specifics
- Kernel skeleton: registry, principals, events, modules, vcs

**Workstreams** (worktrees off `main`)
- `wt/strip` — product-strip + import fixes
- `wt/kernel` — `src/lib/kernel/` + `modules/` skeleton (new files only; merges clean)

**Decisions**
- Orchestrator model adopted (AGENTS.md): subagents + worktrees, progress in `plan/`
- CLI dropped from Phase 0; OpenAPI generation stays
- Telegram gateway = company general assistant ("the orchestrator"), allowlist auth
- Strip table (billing out, PWA out, memory/MCP/job-queue/owlery-client in) — see phase-0 plan

**Next**
- Strip merged → tests green → kernel skeleton → pilot modules → orchestrator via Telegram
