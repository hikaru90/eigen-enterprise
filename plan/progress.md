## 2026-09-07 — Kernel skeleton + product strip merged to main

**Shipped**
- **Strip** (`ebf9295`, merged): removed billing/wallet/PayPal (−10.6k lines, 143 files), PWA/service-worker, product branding (DESIGN.md, assets.af, eigenmesh csv). Relocations: `billing/context.ts`→`db/tenant-context.ts`, `billing/platform-llm.ts`→`llm/`, `billing/preferences.ts`→`llm/`, `byok-ui.ts`→`settings/`. Kept: `llm/gateway-cost`, owlery client, messages/, evals/, docs/.
- **Kernel skeleton** (`fcddc48`, merged): `src/lib/kernel/` — registry (single execute path: permission→approval→zod-validate→handler→audit→vcs-commit), principals, events (append-only contract), modules (fail-closed activation), vcs (GitCommitter, `EE_VCS_AUTOCOMMIT=0` opt-out), approvals (latest-decision-wins gate). Tables: `kernel_principals`, `kernel_events`, `kernel_module_activations`, `kernel_approvals` + drizzle journal idx 70.
- Integration on main verified: kernel tests 30/30 green; `npm run check` 5 errors = documented eigen baseline (vapid ×3, posthog public env ×2); full vitest needs dev DB running (user starts it).

**Broke / flags**
- Service-worker was ALSO the web-push + capture-queue worker — web push is inert until it gets a new home. Accepted for v0 (Telegram is the push channel).
- `billingMode` DB column + wallet tables still in schema (migrations out of strip scope). Cosmetic leftovers: eigen-green theme, "Eigen Mesh" i18n strings, PWA deps in package.json.

**Decisions**
- Approval gate design: registry consults `ApprovalStore.latestFor(tool, principal)` — approved→proceed, pending→`approval_required` (no dup requests), none→create request + throw. Denied → new request.
- Registry collaborators are constructor-injected (EventSink/ApprovalPolicy/ApprovalStore/VcsCommitter); DB-backed stores land next.
- Worktree flow proved: `wt/strip` (mutating) and `wt/kernel` (additive) ran in parallel, merged clean.

**Next workstreams**
- `wt/wire`: DB-backed kernel stores + module manifests (memory, email) + MCP server rendered from kernel registry + OpenAPI generator + parity test
- `wt/gateway`: `modules/chat-gateway/` — Telegram long-polling, session mapping, allowlist (→ principals), chunking; migration idx 71

## 2026-09-07 — Phase 0 kickoff

**Shipped**
- `plan/phase-0-kernel.md` — approved architecture (grilled across 5 rounds)
- Repo seeded from eigen (`c4642f1` — tree unmodified: rsync w/o `.git`, `node_modules`, artifacts, `.env`)
- `AGENTS.md` — orchestrator model + guardrails written

**In progress**
- Strip: `billing/` (keep `llm/gateway-cost`), eigenmesh branding, PWA/service-worker, product deploy specifics
- Kernel skeleton: registry, principals, events, modules, vcs

**Workstreams** (worktrees off `main`)
- `wt/strip` — product-strip + import fixes
- `wt/kernel` — `src/lib/kernel/` + `modules/` skeleton (new files only; merges clean)

**Decisions**
- Orchestrator model adopted (AGENTS.md): subagents + worktrees, progress in `plan/`
- CLI dropped from Phase 0; OpenAPI generation stays
- Telegram gateway = company general assistant ("the orchestrator"), allowlist auth
- Strip table (billing out, PWA out, memory/MCP/job-queue/owlery-client in) — see phase-0 plan

**Next**
- Strip merged → tests green → kernel skeleton → pilot modules → orchestrator via Telegram
